This is your project plan. Start with your project ideas document, add more concrete details, and polish it up. Your plan should also account for the time itâ€™ll take to find the right R package(s) for what you want to do.


# 1. Comparing English speakers' Korean learning development with Korean speakers' English learning development.


## Brief summary

I would like to compare the process of the development of L2 learners with different background. According to Foreign Service Institute (FIS), for English native speakers, Korean is one of the most difficult languages to learn. Same thing would apply to Koreans; one of the most difficult languages to learn for Koreans is English. So, I would like to compare each group of speakers' development process in terms of lexical diversity and syntactic complexity based on their L2 level.


## Data 

For this project, I am considering using two datasets, which are PELIC, and a data set from an article about Korean L2 writing. Below is the article's title and its authors:

Lim, K., Song, J., & Park, J. (2022). Neural automated writing evaluation for Korean L2 writing. Natural Language Engineering, _Cambridge University Press, 1-23._ https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324922000298. Lim, K. and Song, J. contributed equally.

Both data sets are available for public use.


## Analysis

Since Korean is a synthetic language and has a rich vocabulary pool of honorifics which are reflected to most of the ending morphemes, there are numerous morphemes that can be considered conjunctive particles. Therefore, I assume that at the relatively lower level of L2 speakers, English learners have a higher degree of syntactic complexity. However, for the upper level of L2 speakers, Korean learners shows higher level of syntactic complexity. In terms of lexical diversity, I assume no difference between two groups.
