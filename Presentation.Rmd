# Developmental process of L2 - English and Korean

## Background information and Research Qeustions

According to Foreign Service Institute (FIS), Korean belongs to the languages exceptionally difficult for those whose first language is English.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Hardest_Languages_02-1.jpg")
```


Why is it difficult?

 - Different sentence structure
 - classifiers / case markers
 - verb conjugation (!)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("korean_verb.jpg")

```

 - Different language type in terms of morphosyntax

   * English: Analytic (by using specific grammatical words) (Britannica, 2011)
      - English ***DOES*** have some features that synthetic language possess.
      - Nevertheless, closer to analytic language.
   
   
  
   * Korean: Synthetic (by inflecting words or adding morphemes) (Britannica, 2011)
   
   -> There might be a difference in the developmental process in each language learners caused by this feature.
   

**One N.B.: different approach in tokenization is needed in the case of Korean**
   
### My Research question

1. Between which levels does the language proficiency increase the most? 
 
    A. Lexical diversity
  
    B. Syntactic complexity
  
2. Is there any difference in terms of *lexical diversity* and *syntactic complexity* in the same level of different L2 speakers?


### My Hypothesis about this data

1. There would be no big difference with regards to lexical diversity; the degree of improvement in English will be similar in both learner's corpus.

2. With regards to the syntactic complexity, English learners will show a biggest leap in the earlier stage than Korean learners


## Data Analysis


  TTR: type token ratio per person, grouped by their level, calculated mean

### General Observation_Lexical Diversity

  * How I tidied up the data

#### KLC


1. A sharp peak at level B1 followed by a sharper plunge at B2.
  
   Considering the mean text length, it is expectable.
   
2. A2 vs. C1 - *more than double* the size in mean text length, but same TTR.

3. Expected that mean text length also increase by the level; not true.

4. Between level A2 and B1, TTR increased by .04.
    
  And the mean text length also *increased by almost 40%.*



#### PELIC

1. Quite steady TTR compared to that of KLC.

   Between level 3 and 4, the text length increased 20%; and TTR also increase.
 
2. Between level 4 and 5, TTR increased. But the mean text length decreased.


#### Comparison

1. Level B2 and level 4 - longest mean text length across all levels, not level C1 and level 5.

2. Both the highest level ranked 2nd in terms of TTR.

3. Answering to my research question..

     **Between which levels does the language proficiency increase the most?**

-> KLC: Between level A2 and B1       //      PELIC: Between level 3 and 4.

    **KLC** shows greater improvement in earlier stage of learning.
    
    
    **Is there any difference in terms of *lexical diversity* in the same level of different L2 speakers?**

 * Level B1, Level 3
 
  - In KLC, mean text length increased, and TTR as well. But in PELIC, 
  mean text length increased, but TTR ***decreased**
 
 * What about Level B2 and Level 4?
 
 - Can also find difference; in KLC TTR substantially decreased whereas it increased slightly in PELIC.
 
 - _However_, the sample size!

### General Observation_Syntactic Complexity

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("KLC_SC.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("PELIC_SC.jpg")
```

#### KLC

1. Increased steadily across all level 

2. Biggest improvement: from B1 to B2

3. There was no unexpected change - A2 the lowest, C1, the highest.


#### PELIC

1. Steady increase, just like KLC

2. Biggest improvement: from level 2 to level 3. 

3. From level 3 to 5, no big difference, which is a surprise.



#### Comparison


1. Level B1 vs. Level 3: PELIC has higher mean sentence length.
   But, Level B2 vs. Level 4: KLC is A LOT higher.


1. Answering to my research question..

     **Between which levels does the language proficiency increase the most?**

-> KLC: Between level B1 and B2       //      PELIC: Between level 2 and 3.

  **PELIC** shows greater improvement in earlier stage of learning.

    **Is there any difference in terms of *syntactic complexity* in the same level of different L2 speakers?**

  In Level B1 and Level 3, PELIC has higher mean sentence length, 
  but in Level B2 and Level 4, KLC outdistance PELIC!
  And this aspect persists in Level C1 and Level 5, too.



## Limitations


 * Discrepancy in sample size.
 

 * Longer sentence, better written?
   NO!
  
  What do we need more?
  
  -> Vocabulary level; Common, everyday words vs. sophisticated & technical words
