# Developmental process of L2 - English and Korean

## Background information and Research Qeustions

According to Foreign Service Institute (FIS), Korean belongs to the languages exceptionally difficult for those whose first language is English.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Hardest_Languages_02-1.jpg")
```
Why is it difficult?

 - Different sentence structure
 - classifiers / case markers
 - verb conjugation (!)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("korean_verb.jpg")

```

 *- different language type in terms of morphosyntax*
   English: Analytic (by using specific grammatical words) (Britannica, 2011)
   Korean: Synthetic (by inflecting words or adding morphemes) (Britannica, 2011)
   
   
**My Research question: **

Is there any difference in terms of *lexical diversity* and *syntactic complexity* if learners of each language have the same level of L2?


 you should start with _motivating_ and _contextualizing_ your project topic. That means supplying background information, research questions, theoretical foundations and related literature, and so on.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, comment="")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(repurrrsive)
library(quanteda)
library(magrittr)
```
