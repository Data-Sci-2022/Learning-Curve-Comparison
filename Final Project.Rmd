# Developmental process of L2 - English and Korean

## Background information and Research Qeustions

According to Foreign Service Institute (FIS), Korean belongs to the languages exceptionally difficult for those whose first language is English.


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Hardest_Languages_02-1.jpg")
```
Why is it difficult?

 - Different sentence structure
 - classifiers / case markers
 - verb conjugation (!)

```{r}

```

 - Different language type in terms of morphosyntax

   * English: Analytic (by using specific grammatical words) (Britannica, 2011)
   
   * Korean: Synthetic (by inflecting words or adding morphemes) (Britannica, 2011)
   
   -> There might be a difference in the developmental process in each language learners caused by this feature.
   
      ''' In the case of English, we can tokenize the corpus mostly by white space because it is usually the case that units divided by a white space is a word. In the case of Korean, we have case markers, which are used attached to the root of nouns. Also, in the case of tense markers, (or modal verb?) while it can be used alone in English (e.g. will, have), they cannot be used alone and always have to be attached to the end of the verb. And both case markers and tense markers are considered 'a word' in Korean. Also, the rule of spacing word is crazy; it is very often that people whose first langauge is Korean mis-space when they write. And imagine the cases of learners; they must mess up more. So, generally in Korean NLP, we use morpheme, not word segment.'''
   
   
### My Research question_

1. On which level does the language proficiency increase the most? 
  A. Lexical diversity
  B. Syntactic complexity
  
2. Is there any difference in terms of *lexical diversity* and *syntactic complexity* in the same level of different L2 speakers?


### My Hypothesis about this data

1. There would be no big difference with regards to lexical diversity; the degree of improvement in English will be similar in both learner's corpus.

2. With regards to the syntactic complexity, English learners will show a leap in the earlier stage than Korean learners
